The Retail Shop Billing System is a Java-based application designed to simplify the billing process in retail stores. It allows the shopkeeper to add items, enter quantities, calculate prices, and generate the final bill automatically. The system computes the total amount, applies necessary calculations, and displays the complete bill to the user. This project improves accuracy, reduces manual work, and makes the billing process faster and more efficient. It is an excellent project for learning Java GUI, file handling, and basic billing operations.
